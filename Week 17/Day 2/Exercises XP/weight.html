        // Function declarations are "hoisted" to the top of their containing scope. 
        // This means they can be called before their actual definition in the code.
        // For function expressions, The variable to which the function is assigned is hoisted, but the function's definition itself is not. 
        // Therefore, function expressions cannot be called before they are defined in the code.

        //Finally, use a one line arrow function and invoke it.
        let weightTotal = (kg) => kg * 1000;
        console.log(weightTotal(7));
